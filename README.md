For future work on this exercise:
* explore idea of replacing data by a dataset regarding Big5 personality traits
* possible to connect Big5 to music taste
* conduct "study" with students where they have to (anonymously) conduct the Big5 test and provide their music taste and try to find patterns (could compare to other similar studies)
